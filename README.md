This is a project of the 2018-2019 [Brookline High School](http://bhs.brookline.k12.ma.us/career--technology-education.html) (BHS) [AP Computer Science Principles](https://sites.google.com/psbma.org/david-petty/archive/2018-2019/apcsp) class as a post-examination project completed (mostly) by juniors and sophomores in the class.

## New schedule

For the academic years 2019-2020 and 2020-2021, [BHS](http://bhs.brookline.k12.ma.us/) will be [under construction](http://bhs.brookline.k12.ma.us/expansion-project.html). Consequently, grade-9 students will be organized in two [cohorts](http://bhs.brookline.k12.ma.us/9th-grade-transition.html) with part of each day being at Old Lincoln School.
